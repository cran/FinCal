\title{Equivalent/proportional Interest Rates}
\usage{
EIR(r, n = 1, p = 12, type = c("e", "p"))
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{interest rate to be applied n times per year (r is annual rate!)}

\item{n}{times that the interest rate r were compounded per year}

\item{p}{times that the equivalent rate were compounded per year}

\item{type}{equivalent interest rates ('e',default) or proportional interest rates ('p')}
}
\description{
An interest rate to be applied n times p.a. can be converted to an equivalent rate to be applied p times p.a.
}
\examples{
# monthly interest rat equivalent to 5\% compounded per year
EIR(r=0.05,n=1,p=12)

# monthly interest rat equivalent to 5\% compounded per half year
EIR(r=0.05,n=2,p=12)

# monthly interest rat equivalent to 5\% compounded per quarter
EIR(r=0.05,n=4,p=12)

# annual interest rate equivalent to 5\% compounded per month
EIR(r=0.05,n=12,p=1)
# this is equivalent to
ear(r=0.05,m=12)

# quarter interest rate equivalent to 5\% compounded per year
EIR(r=0.05,n=1,p=4)

# quarter interest rate equivalent to 5\% compounded per month
EIR(r=0.05,n=12,p=4)

# monthly proportional interest rate which is equivalent to a simple annual interest
EIR(r=0.05,p=12,type='p')
